Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student in **Electrical and Computer Engineering (Photonics)** at the [University of California San Diego (UCSD)](https://www.ucsd.edu/) and a member of the [Integrated Photonics Group](https://ece.ucsd.edu/) (Mookherjea Lab), where my research focuses on hybrid electro-optic modulators and wafer-scale silicon photonics integration.

Before joining UCSD, I worked as a **Lecturer and Lab Coordinator** at [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/), teaching undergraduate courses in Circuits, Electronics, and Microprocessors, and contributing to **outcome-based education (OBE)** curriculum development. Prior to that, I worked as a **Research Assistant** at the NSU Optics Lab and as a **Teaching Assistant** in the **Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering** at [North South University (NSU)](https://www.northsouth.edu/). I completed my **B.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering** (with a minor in Mathematics) at NSU, where I **graduated Summa Cum Laude at the top of my class** (1st of 178 students) with a concentration in **Solid-State Electronics**.
