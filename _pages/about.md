Iâ€™m a Photonics Ph.D. student at the [University of California San Diego (UCSD)](https://www.ucsd.edu/) and a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) at the [Integrated Photonics Group](https://ece.ucsd.edu/), where my research focuses on hybrid electro-optic modulators and wafer-scale silicon photonics integration.

Before joining UCSD, I worked as a Lecturer and Lab Coordinator at [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/), teaching undergraduate courses in Circuits, Electronics, and Microprocessors. Prior to that, I worked as a Research Assistant (RA) at the NSU Optics Lab and as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [North South University (NSU)](https://www.northsouth.edu/).

I completed my B.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (with a minor in Mathematics) at NSU, where I graduated Summa Cum Laude at the top of my class with a concentration in Solid-State Electronics.
