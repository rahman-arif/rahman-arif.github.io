  abstract = {Heterogeneously-integrated electro-optic modulators (EOM) are demonstrated using the hybrid-mode concept, incorporating thin-film lithium niobate (LN) by bonding with silicon nitride (SiN) passive photonics. At wavelengths near 1550 nm, these EOMs demonstrated greater than 30 dB extinction ratio, 3.8 dB on-chip insertion loss, a low-frequency half-wave voltage-length product (VÏ€L) of 3.8 V.cm, and a 3-dB EO modulation bandwidth exceeding 110 GHz. This work demonstrates the combination of multi-layer low-loss SiN waveguides with high-performance LN EOMs made in a scalable fabrication process using conventional low-resistivity silicon (Si) wafers.}
