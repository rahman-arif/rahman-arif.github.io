  abstract = {We report the development of wafer-scale hybrid lithium niobate (LN) electro-optic modulators integrated with low-loss silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides. The hybrid LN-SiN devices demonstrate an on-chip insertion loss of 3.8 dB, an extinction ratio exceeding 30 dB, a low-frequency half-wave voltage–length product VπL of 3.8 V·cm, and an electro-optic 3-dB bandwidth beyond 110 GHz. This heterogeneous platform combines the high-speed, high-efficiency electro-optic response of LN with the scalability and low propagation loss of SiN photonics, enabling wafer-scale integration of ultra-broadband optical modulators for next-generation communication and signal-processing applications.}
